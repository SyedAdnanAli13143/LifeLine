The ambitious vision of our Final Year Project (FYP) is to pioneer a transformative 
web application that leverages the latest technological advancements, including 
.NET Core, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, to redefine the landscape of patientcentric healthcare. Our project is a testament to our commitment to enhancing the 
patient experience and revolutionizing healthcare information management.
At its core, this innovative system seeks to empower patients by granting them 
unprecedented control over their healthcare journey. Here's a glimpse of the remarkable features and capabilities that will shape the future of healthcare 
access
In essence, our Final Year Project is not just a web application; it's a healthcare 
revolution that places patients at the center of their medical care. By harnessing 
cutting-edge technologies, we aim to empower individuals to take charge of their 
health, enhance their overall healthcare experience, and foster stronger, more 
collaborative relationships between patients and healthcare providers.
